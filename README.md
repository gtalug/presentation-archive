# presentation-archive

Archive of all the stuff from past GTALUG meetings.

## Add a Presentation

The folder section for a normal meeting should be `<year>/<month>` (ex. `2015/12`) if it's a bunch of Lightening talks it should be `<year>/<month>/<name>_<presentation_name>` (ex. `2015/12/myles-braithwaite_couchdb`).
